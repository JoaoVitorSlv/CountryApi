# 🌍 Country Explorer with React

This is a simple and clean React application that demonstrates how to consume external APIs to display country data and related images. The project integrates two APIs:

- **REST Countries API** – for country details and flags
- **Unsplash API** – for background images related to the selected country

## 🚀 Features

- Fetch and display all countries with flags
- Click on a country to view more info and related photos
- Responsive grid layout with Tailwind CSS
- Built using React Router, Hooks, and modular API service structure
